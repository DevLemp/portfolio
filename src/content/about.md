Hi! I’m **Christodoulos Lemperos**, an **AI Automation Engineer** based in **Dubai**.

I specialize in building practical automations that handle repetitive workflows so teams can focus on what matters.

**Current Focus:**
- Workflow automation: WhatsApp, email, Google Sheets, Notion
- Web & back-end: React, Node.js, Python, APIs
- Databases: SQL, MongoDB
- Productivity tools & AI integrations

I deliver **quick wins, not overengineered solutions**.  
Open to small automation projects, collaborating with founders, or building internal tools for teams.
